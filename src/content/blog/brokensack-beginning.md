A few days back I saw numerous blog websites and liked their minimal look and feel. Although I write *some* blogs on [realogs](https://blog.realogs.in) I still wanted to have such a minimal site for my writings. Therefore I decided to get a small quick blog running.

Here I plan to post blogs related to interesting tech, code/Linux-related topics, and random thoughts/opinions.

I used a popular web framework called Astro to build this website. It only took me about four hours to set up the initial blog and styling, which is pretty impressive. I haven't decided yet where I will host the site, but I'm considering either Vercel or a VPS.
